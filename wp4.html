        <td>Objectives: Implementation of TSO framework developed in WP2 to characteristic case studies.
          Description of Work: The TSO framework developed in WP2 will be applied for the optimized
          design of characteristic case studies, including steel structural elements, connections and simple
          structures. Task 4.1 Design optimization: In this Task: (i) Members of varying cross-section will be
          optimized, such as hollowsection pylons of stay and back-stay cables in suspended roofs and Isection, long-span bridge girders. The end geometry of the members to accommodate their
          connections will be included in the optimization process. (ii) Joints between steel members of
          varying orientation, cross-sectional shape and action effects will be optimized. The sections of
          adjoining members will be used as imposed constraints, to which the geometry of the joint will
          have to adapt. (iii) Simple structural systems, such as trusses for pedestrian bridges or industrial
          applications will be optimized, taking into account aesthetic and/or geometry constraints. The
          constitutive relations obtained in WP3 will be employed in the optimization process. Task 4.2
          Parametric Design for Design Optimization: In Task 4.2, the application of Parametric Design
          principles, that are used as the platform of operation towards the design optimization of
          structures, and related case studies will be reviewed and discussed further, suggesting in parallel
          possible directions of investigation. Parametric Design allows the effective design development
          of any complex and non-standard architectural and structural system55. Within this framework,
          Parametric Design tools will be applied for: a) 3D modelling and geometrical development of
          suggested structural morphologies, b) Morphological and behavioral control of structures during
          the process of optimization, c) as well as in view of the fabrication technique to be applied. Aim
          is the real time evaluation of structuresâ€™ performance according to Additive Manufacturing
          criteria and constraints in a continuous feedback loop process leading to the best possible
          solutions in each case study that can be effectively fabricated.
