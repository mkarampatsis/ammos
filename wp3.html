        <td>Objectives: The main objective of WP3 is to define the material constitutive relations that need to
          be introduced in the optimization procedure that will be carried out in WP4. Description of Work:
          The mechanical properties of the 3D printed objects, among others, are highly affected by the
          consumables used, especially in case of recycled powder feedstock. Moreover, the GMNIA-based
          design procedure that is part of the nonlinear TSO methodology developed in WP2 relies on the
          material properties considered, thus a reliable description of the material constitutive relations is
          highly important. In this WP the determination of the material constitutive relations is achieved
          by two Tasks. Task 3.1 Production, processing and classification of the recycled powder: The
          production, processing, sorting and dispatching of the most suitable powder for AM
          technologies is a promising field. In this Task using the metal powder pelletizer of the “Interuniversity Center for the Development of High Value-Added Processes and Products from the
          Recovery/Exploitation of Waste” of NTUA lower quality metal powders will be converted to high
          value-added raw materials suitable for AM processing. Task 3.2 3D printing of specific steel
          specimens including recycled consumables: In this task using the upgraded recycled powder of
          Task 3.1 and conventional consumables appropriately scaled 3D printed coupons will be
          manufactured in appropriate shape, size and number, as specified by EN10002-1. In particular 10
          steel specimens will be manufactured, half of them using conventional consumables and the
          other half with recycled ones. Task 3.3 Experimental testing: Then tension tests (10 specimens: 5
          with conventional and 5 using recycled consumables) will be performed at the Institute of Steel
          Structures of NTUA in order to determine material constitutive relations, using the available
          infrastructure, including strong floor, testing frames, actuators and measuring devices, properly
          connected to a centralized control system. Results will be compared with test results of 3D
          printed steel that are available in the recent literature. Guidelines for numerical modeling of
          material nonlinearity will be formulated. Task 3.4 Calibration of material constitutive relations: In
          order to identify the parameters of the material constitutive laws for steel and for each type of
          consumables adopted (conventional and recycled) a material law will be developed based on
          inverse analysis carried out by means of a metaheuristic-based search algorithm (Kallioras et al.
          201853), for this reason parameterized constitutive relations will be chosen from the literature in
          order to be calibrated through inverse analysis procedure (Chamekh et al. 200654).
