        <td>Objectives: The main objective of WP3 is to define the material constitutive relations that need to
          be introduced in the optimization procedure that will be carried out in WP4. Description of Work:
          The mechanical properties of the 3D printed objects, among others, are highly affected by the
          3D printing technology and parameters. Moreover, the GMNIA-based
          design procedure that is part of the nonlinear TSO methodology developed in WP2 relies on the
          material properties considered, thus a reliable description of the material constitutive relations is
          highly important. In this WP the determination of the material constitutive relations is achieved
          by four Tasks. Task 3.1 Test planning: Planning of an extensive experimental campaign for the printing machining and testing of over 100 tensille coupons, aiming at exploring the effect of printng parameters (heat input, deposition rate) and of the machining (machined and unmachined coupons) on the resulting constitutive relations. Task 3.2 3D printing and shaping of the above mentioned steel
          specimens employ Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM): In this task the coupons proposed in Task 3.1 will be 3D printed and then
          manufactured in appropriate shape and size, as specified by EN10002-1. In particular over 100
          steel specimens will be manufactured for different combinations of heat input and deposition rate. Half of them will be machined and the other half not, in order to determine the effect of undulations on their mechanical response. Task 3.3 Experimental testing: Then tension tests of the above mentioned over 100 specimens will be performed at the Institute of Steel
          Structures of NTUA in order to determine material constitutive relations, using the available
          infrastructure, including strong floor, testing frames, actuators and measuring devices, properly
          connected to a centralized control system. Results will be compared with test results of 3D
          printed steel that are available in the recent literature. The dependence of constitutive relationson the printing parameters will be quantified, thus covering a distinctive gap in the literature. Guidelines for numerical modeling of
          material nonlinearity will be formulated. Task 3.4 Calibration of material constitutive relations: In
          order to identify the parameters of the material constitutive laws for steel and for each type of
          consumables adopted (conventional and recycled) a material law will be developed based on
          inverse analysis carried out by means of a metaheuristic-based search algorithm (Kallioras et al.
          201853), for this reason parameterized constitutive relations will be chosen from the literature in
          order to be calibrated through inverse analysis procedure (Chamekh et al. 200654).
