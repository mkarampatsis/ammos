        <td>Objectives: In this WP the optimized structural elements, derived in WP4 will be 3D printed.
          Description of Work: Appropriately scaled 3D printed specimens of the optimized designs of
          WP4 will be manufactured. The scale will be chosen taking into account the characteristics of the
          available 3D printer and the capacity of available testing facilities at the Institute of Steel
          Structures at NTUA in terms of specimen size, actuator loading range and anchoring ability. In
          particular, three specimens will be manufactures for each one of the following three categories:
          (a) a structural element, (b) a joint and (c) a simple structure. This WP will be concentrated on the
          investigation and development of physical prototyping methods based on Additive
          Manufacturing that can be applied in various scales of suggested structural components
          (structural elements and joints) and systems, aiming at further evaluation according to their
          constructability, their ability to be easily assembled as well as according to their structural
          performance and properties. The numerical control of construction processes is considered as an
          indispensable part of the Parametric Design investigation due to the ability of digital tools to be
          effectively used for the Additive Manufacturing of complex and non-standard morphologies56.
          According to the case studies under investigation, Additive Manufacturing strategies will be
          suggested, taking into consideration in each case the ability of 3D printers to be effectively
          applied in order to achieve desirable outcomes based on the selected scale of investigation. In
          the early stage of the process, small scale prototypes for visualization purposes as well as larger
          scale prototypes close to the actual scale of the structures are necessary to be developed.
