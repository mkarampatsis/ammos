        <td>Objectives: In WP1 the administrative and financial obligations of the team members will be
          performed, including coordination of the project, reporting, supervision and communication
          support. Description of work: PI will supervise the financial status of the project, negotiate
          contractual and administrative issues or possible project modifications, revise project planning
          when appropriate, allocate project resources and schedule tasks in case that modifications turn
          out to be necessary or advantageous. Primarily PI aims at preventing any deviation from the
          original work plan (e.g. by ensuring that results from the WPs are available on time and are of
          high quality). PI ensures that WPs are supported adequately in his responsibility for
          administrative coordination and performance control of the Task-related operations, (e.g. coststatements, summary reports, deliverables etc.) ensuring that adequate resources are at the
          disposal of the project. Regarding the financial progress, PI will follow-up project expenses and
          track deviations. PI will perform cost management activity which includes the processes required
          to ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget. Concerning cost control, PI
          will abide project requirements, including monitoring of the cost performance to detect
          deviations from the original plan, accurate recording in the cost baseline, preventing of incorrect,
          inappropriate, or un-authorized changes of the contract. All required reporting documents to
          GGET/ESPA will be created within WP1 by PI. In addition, the relevant research activities
          performed at European and international level in the field of the project and related topics will
          be closely monitored by PI throughout the duration of the project. Contacts with the
          organisations performing such research and/or industrial activities will be established through PI
          aiming to avoid work duplication, to maximise project efficiency and to activate synergies
          between projects.
