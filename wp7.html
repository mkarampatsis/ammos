        <td>Objectives: The objective is to perform small-scale demonstration in order to validate the
          components. Description of Work: The numerical results obtained in WP4 will be compared to
          corresponding experimental results of WP6 as a means of validating the overall optimization /
          design / manufacturing methodology. The optimization algorithms developed in WP2 will then
          be employed for the design of a wider range of case studies at real scale, which will be used for
          further demonstrating the methodology and disseminating the research results. In WP7
          verification and validation procedures will be implemented for each of the software components
          of the proposed project. An extensive survey of the existing scientific literature and technological
          standards will be conducted. Verification and validation methods will apply, where applicable,
          existing acknowledged methodologies. Task 7.1 Verification: This task involves the process of
          ensuring that the conceptual model has been carefully transformed into a computer model with
          sufficient accuracy; in other words, the mathematical concern of building the model right will be
          addressed. Early verification tests will be applied during the development of each module in
          order to correct unexpected deviations. Task 7.2 Validation: This task involves the process of
          ensuring that the conceptual model is sufficiently accurate to represent the real world from the
          perspective of its intended uses; in other words, the physical concern of building the right model
          will be addressed. It will be applied only after the verification has been done. Standard
          experiment outcomes will be considered. Task 7.3 Dissemination: The scientific and technical
          outcomes of the project will be published in the best journals in the field of structural
          engineering and design optimization, as well as in journals specialized in additive manufacturing.
          It is also planned to present the developed methods and achieved results in selected
          international conferences and workshops in those fields as well as to specialized exhibitions,
          summits and showcases.
