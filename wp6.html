        <td>Objectives: In order to justify that the structural capacity of the 3D printed specimens is in
          compliance with the one predicted numerically; experimental testing will be performed.
          Description of Work: Experimental tests of the 3D printed specimens manufactured in WP5 will
          be carried out. Tests will be displacement-controlled, based on the numerical simulations of
          WP4. Specimens will be loaded to collapse in order to determine their ultimate strength. Tests
          will be performed at the Institute of Steel Structures at NTUA, using the available infrastructure,
          including strong floor, testing frames, actuators and measuring devices, properly connected to a
          centralized control system. As stated in WP5 for purposes of verification of the results obtained,
          three specimens will be tested for each one of the following three categories: (a) one structural
          element, (b) one joint and (c) one simple structure.
