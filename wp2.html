        <td>Objectives: The topology-sizing optimization methodology based on nonlinear FE analyses will
          be developed in WP2. Description of Work: A completely novel topology-sizing optimization
          framework will be developed, in which the capability of performing Linear Buckling (LBA,
          Dimopoulos and Gantes 201251) and GMNI Analyses as well as treating multiple loading cases in
          each iteration will be incorporated. Task 2.1 nonlinear TSO methodology: In this Task the
          proposed Nonlinear Analyses based Topology-Sizing Design Optimization methodology will be
          developed, that is composed of three stages: In the first one, the TO approaches will be used,
          improved in terms of computational efficiency (see Task 2.2); they will be based on the classical
          elasticity theory for continuous media and simple stress constraints, but taking into account
          multiple loading combinations (the design loading conditions). This will lead to roughly
          optimized shapes of the structural elements (members, nodes) or structures. In the second one,
          labelled as the interpretation stage, the optimized shapes resulted from the first stage will be
          interpreted into CAD designs. More specifically, for structural elements, joint or structures, 3D
          CAD designs and then FE discretized models will be created automatically, for truss-like
          structures an automatic procedure will also be implemented generating truss structures, verifying
          also that the produced trusses will not correspond to a mechanism. The resulting interpreted
          design composed of tubular or rod structural elements will be used as starting configurations for
          the third stage that will comprise a sizing design optimization procedure based on buckling and
          nonlinear analyses, more information on the design procedure is provided in Task 2.3. Through
          these iterations the roughly optimized shape of the first stage will be further optimized so that
          all verifications against all pertinent failure mechanisms will be included in the analysis. This
          approach has obvious advantages, as the final optimized shape at the end of the third stage will
          require no further interpretation or additional checks to be manufactured. Task 2.2 parallel
          implementation of the methodology: In this Task the high computational demands of the
          nonlinear TSO methodology will be treated into a parallel computing environment52 taking
          advantage of the progress on CPU and GPGPU hardware. Task 2.3 Design of steel members,
          connections and structures with non-linear FEM analyses: In order to design steel members,
          connections and structures with non-linear FEM analyses, a Linearized Buckling Analysis (LBA)
          will first be performed, in order to obtain buckling mode shapes that will then be adopted as
          initial imperfections for the subsequent Geometry and Material Nonlinear Analysis with
          Imperfections (GMNIA). Such analysis incorporates all verifications against all pertinent failure
          mechanisms and is a valid alternative to code-based design for conventional structures, while it
          is the only solution for structures with unconventional geometry.
